<h1>Philosophers</h1>

<h2>Decription</h2>

<p>The Philosophers project is a simulation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem, a well-known concurrency problem in computer science. The simulation involves multiple philosophers seated around a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti in the center and a fork placed between each pair of philosophers. Each philosopher alternates between thinking, eating, and sleeping, ensuring that no philosopher starves. The simulation is designed to explore synchronization and thread management using mutexes to control access to shared resources.</p>
